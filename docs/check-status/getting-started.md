# ❓ Checking Verification Status & Build History

## ❓ Checking Verification Status & Build History

Whether you are an UI/interface wanting to surface a Canister's verification status in Cover; or a user/developer wanting to confirm your live canister's WASM checksum matches your latest submission on Cover (and therefore is considered verified!), you will need to **query Cover for this information**.


**What information can you query from Cover?**

You can query **all the information** that is provided when new submissions are made, that includes:

- WASM Checksum
- Canister ID
- Link to the repository
- Build information

All that information will be versioned and can be utilized to compare the WASM checksum of the live canister, and verify it is up to date and verified with the open source submitted core.
