CAP is a standard agnostic open internet service that provides transaction history & asset provenance to assets (NFTs and Tokens) on the IC.

It solves the issue that there is **no standard for transaction history/provenance** when it comes to assets (or activity in general) on the Internet Computer in a scalable and trustless way that any project can integrate and that is flexible enough to evolve into **general activity provenance in the future** (recording any type of event for any type of project).
