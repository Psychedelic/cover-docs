## ✅ Cover Usage

## Environment set up

To set up the build environment, you need to add Cover's dockerfile to your repo and then build your canister.

[Visit our builder repo for more details on guidance](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover-builder#usage)

##  Build your canister

You can build your canister by providing Cover builder with your build config (these configs are going to be validated by **Cover Validator** first). There are 3 ways to do this:

- Using **Cover Validator** API ([Guidance and example](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover-validator))
- Using **Cover SDK** ([Guidance and example](https://github.com/Psychedelic/cover-sdk))
- Using [**Cover App**](https://app.covercode.ooo/) to submit your build config

Verifications of the latest build will be stored in Cover canister. 

!!! Note

    Your canister´s repository should be on GitHub, and open source
